# LaunchHop

Launch a process but in a complicated way (Windows only)

## Features

+ Launch a process with a different executable
> E.g. If you use `launchhop.exe` and configured correctly to launch `StarRail.exe` it'll be something like this
> `launchhop.exe` -> `launcher.exe` -> `StarRail.exe` (then Star Rail will see `launcher.exe` as the parent process)

## Usage

1. Download the latest release (the `-release` file is the one you want)
2. Changge the `config.toml` to your needs
3. Run `launchhop.exe`
> If the application doesn't launch, try launching with administrator
